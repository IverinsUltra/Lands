This page explains how the wars system of Lands works for players.

**1. Declare War**\
To declare war against your enemy, simply execute `/Wars declare <land>`.\
Now a menu will open which asks you about setting a tribute. This tribute will be payed by the enemy (defender) in case they surrender later.\
After you clicked on the send button, the enemy will receive your war declaration with information, like when the war starts and which tribute you set in case they want to surrender.

**2. War Preparation Time**\
After the declaration is sent, the war preparation time starts. During this time the defender has time to prepare against for the upcoming fight. How long the preparation time is depends on your servers configuration. All players of both lands will get a notification periodically. By executing `/Wars info` or `/Wars menu` you can get information about the upcoming war.

**3. The War starts**\
When the war preparation time is over all players of both lands are able to fight against their enemy. There may be certain options enabled on your server that prevent invading the enemies land, while their players are offline. By executing `/Wars info` or `/Wars menu` you can get information about the current war.

**4. During the War**\
During the war time you may be able to invade the enemies land and steal items from their containers, but this fully depends on your servers configuration. You may even be able to break and place certain or all blocks. Again, this depends on the server you're playing on. Also the server may have configured a minimum amount of members of the enemy which need to be online, before you can invade their land.

**5. The War is over**\
Your server has a configured max. war time, which will be visible for you during the war time. The team with the most kills wins the war. The winner will be rewarded with a robbery money amount with is taken from the defenders balance (usually their land bank; this depends on your servers configuration). Your server may also have setup custom rewards in the Lands wars config. If both teams have the same amount of kills, the war will end in a draw and no team will be rewarded. Depending on your servers configuration you may receive a war shield.
